# React GraphQL Go Boilerplate !!
(VERY) Simple setup for React with Server side rendering ( NextJS ) with GraphQL server serve by Go.

I am now trying to avoid Javascript as much as I can (due to personal opinion)

# Development

### Prerequisite
- Install Go compiler and go dep
- gnu make
- nodejs 8.9 ++

```
// will reload Go and Javascript dependencies
$ make prepare 

// run go server
$ make serve-server 

// build and run client server
$ make serve-client 


// Go to http://localhost:3000
```
